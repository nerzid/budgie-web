## Features

- **Free-Text and Custom Actions**: Users can send messages in free-text format or create custom actions to send instead of text. 
- **Predefined Utterance Preview**: If a created action matches predefined utterances in the scenario, a preview of the utterance is shown.
- **Asynchronous Action Processing**: No turn-taking is required; actions are sent and processed asynchronously, allowing for smooth and dynamic interactions.
- **Agent Selection**: Users can choose any agent at any time to interact with the dialogue system. The system automatically picks the other available agent to respond.
- **Scenario Selection and Restart**: Users can choose any available scenario and restart the dialogue for the chosen scenario at any time.
- **Session Management**: Users can switch between "Chat" and "Sessions" tabs to interact with the dialogue system or view session information.

To start, the user needs to:

1. Choose a scenario.
2. Select an agent.
3. Begin the dialogue.
